# Four_Bar
This project was undertaken with the cardinal objective of optimization of transmission angle of a four-bar linkage with an optimum value of 90 degrees with a desired uncertainty via adjustment of the linkage lengths. In addition to the optimization of transmission angle, the program is also competent of graphical simulation and demonstrating the inevitable deviations in the functioning of a four-bar linkage mechanism from the actual function through an error curve for varied number of accuracy points.
The program is also capable of predicting the type of the four-bar mechanism based on Grashoff criterions, i.e, whether it is double crank, crank-rocker or a double rocker mechanism.
The project is wholly program and algorithm based and was integrally performed on MATLAB. For a four bar linkage, equating the constraints with A,B,C,D in anti-clockwise manner with D as fixed length. The governing equation for lengths are given by Freudensteinâ€™s Equation and obvious geometric constraints.
